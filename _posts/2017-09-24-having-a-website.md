I have had a website since 1994. Until about 1999, everything I wrote just got wiped out the next time I made an edit. I started using Blogger at that time, which was a "way of writing" as much as it was a technical tool. I helped people figure out Movable Type and WordPress, but wrote my own "blog" site that I kept up until 2004-ish.

What happened in 2004? I think that was the start of Twitter and Facebook, where you didn't really have to start a website to say something on the internet. There had been online communities, of course, but the remapping of those online communities to real-world relationships (through Facebook) and the freedom to self-publish without editing (Twitter) really changed things.

And if I put myself back in there, I'd made some mistakes online. I thought free speech on the internet was an unmitigated good, even though some things that I had said online had followed me around, never got deleted, and hurt people's feelings. It's hard to write anything meaningful on the internet when you know it never forgets. Every opinion quickly becomes outdated; every public statement represents a perspective that the speaker no longer holds.

And maybe that's OK. While I don't want to be associated with everything I write forever, I hope I can write in a way that I don't feel embarrassed after the fact when I learn, when I grow, when I'm wrong, or when I change my mind.

(I still think there's a tension between the desire to share and the danger of oversharing. My plan with this site is to write things that I think are valuable to other people, and not to indulge in navel-gazing. Looking at my past writing, that could be a tough balance to strike.)
