## Now

This is my most recent [Now](http://nownownow.com/about) page. I wrote it on 24 Sept 2017.

My focus these days:

 * My job as the head of technology at a marketing agency.
 * Mindfulness training and a daily meditation habit.
 * Playing and writing music.
 * Political activism and involvement (at a very low level).
 * Finding ways to engage online that are productive, positive, and independent.
 * Writing and speaking with the Modern Apps Live! crew.
 * Building a strong family and watching my children grow up.

Still living in the Twin Cities (MN), but trying to find a new house, so getting this one fixed up as best we can.
